# Django React Starter

### Description

This is a starter for django developers that want to use React as Frontend for their Django Applications. I developed this because I wasted some precious amount of time in figuring out how to integrate django with react and there are not enough materials that covers this aspect of django rest framework. So I created this with the hope that developers especially beginners like me will not have to go through google and stackoverflow hell of searching for answers. 

### Tools Needed

- Node
- npm(comes with node) or yarn
- python 3x

### Installations
Follow the step by step instructions
- Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/uncleabbey/django-react-starter.git`
- Change directory into django-react-starter
- To run most python projects, it is recommended to use to run it in a virtual environment. For this, we will be using a virtiual environment called pipenv. Since we have python 3 installed, you already have the pip package, we can install pipenv by running `pip install pipenv`

- After installing pipenv shell. To initialize the virtual environment,  you will run `npm run shell`

- After that you will install django or django rest framework by running  `pipenv install djangorestframework`

- Then we will run `npm install` or `yarn add` to install needed dependencies needed to run webpack

- Once we are through with installations, we can then start our server by running `npm start` then you will see something like this

### Note 
We are using Webpack to bundle our react into javascripts
